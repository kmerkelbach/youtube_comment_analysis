Just for protein to protein interactomes, which are the non-chemical interactions in a cell, the number of arrangements is somewhere around 10^71 billion. One way leads to a functioning cell.

It looks like you cut out the takes between the coin flips to make it \"appear\" that you got the desired results on the first try.

Look, we are not even talking about entropy here (which we should). I hope you see why I have taken the time to point this out. Next time, don't cut out footage and then say it came out all the way you wanted anyway... which also \"questioned\" the real world of entropy as you did point out.  Now, if you had all 3 flipping runs on video with NO cuts at all, then I would beleive you.  Sorry, your dislike stands.  Tell you what, post a follow up video reshowing those exact same 3 coin flip runs with no cuts... if they truly did come out the way you showed them turning out, then I stand corrected and I will give you a like on both.

      "| 114 | So I may have had an insight while watching this: how do trees get water up from their roots to their leaves? A combination of capillary action and osmotic pressure. Given that there can be higher osmotic pressure when ambient temperature is higher, if osmotic pressure is a factor then one would expect to have taller trees in warmer climates, everything else being equal, and I think that’s the case, with the notable exception of redwoods, which grow taller than the tallest tropical rainforest tress.  So perhaps higher temperature providing higher osmotic pressure is part of the explanation but not all.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Key term: tree line.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |     1.20058  |\n",
      "| 142 | I LOVE the overall explanation, but I have a little nitpick about the sugar/water example: At sufficiently high sugar concentrations, statistics is not the only force driving the dilution, but energy (mixing enthalpy) will be released by changing the intermolecular interactions between sugar and water (there will be \"free\" water instead of only \"hydration shell\" water touching other \"hydration shell\" water).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | There's a similar example to this on Cody'sLab, Cody filled a set of balloons with different gases and the balloons with heavy gases that diffuse poorly through latex actually self inflated a bit by absorbing air                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |     0.983466 |\n",
      "|     | By chance we actually produced a physically-chemically better, albeit less tangible, example, when decommissioning an NMR magnet a few months ago: We closed the helium pressure sensing line at the magnet cryostat, but left the pressure sensor at the other end connected. Because the line (plastic hose) was more permeable to helium than to air (as most things tend to be), the pressure inside the hose actually decreased by some 200 mbar below ambient pressure over a few weeks. Helium diffusion from the inside to the outside was more likely than the other way round due to the concentration gradient, and air diffusion in the other direction was hindered by the material of the hose. However, there are no relevant interactions between the different gases that would contribute to this, at least not at the pressures and temperatures we are talking here. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |              |\n",
      "|  45 | Part of why I hate statistics is because people generally use them incorrectly. They confuse probable for definite and possible for probable. One thing to keep in mind regarding coin flipping is that they're basically binary data and if you take an initial state of all flipped in one direction or the other then figure that to flip only one or to flip three from that state the odds are equal, then to end up with one or three flipped in a particular direction is going to be more likely than two flipped in either direction. With just four coins your own chart shows 6 possible states of two flipped one way and two the other, but 8 possible states for 1 and 3.                                                                                                                                                                                                  | 5% water and 95% ink isn’t the same thing as 5% ink and 95% water                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |     0.804818 |\n",

I have seen videos that say faster-than-light travel and portals (like the one in Portal 2) are impossible because they would \"violate causality\" and then whoever is narrating stops there, like violating causality is stupendous and speaks for itself.  As far as I can tell, \"violating causality\" means \"sending information faster than the speed of light\".  I just don't understand what is so bad about this besides the repeated statement \"nothing can go faster than light\".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | \"Causality\" here essentially refers to the idea that the cause of an effect has to happen before that effect. If A causes B, then A has to happen before B. The problem is that if you transmit information faster than light from event A to cause event B somewhere else, then different reference frames will disagree on which of these happened first. So there are reference frames in which B happened before A, even though A caused B.  Causality is broken. And that doesn't make any sense. |     0.426291 |\n",
